# PHP CronExpression

### 表达式说明:

```
       *      *       *        *        *      *
      sec    min    hour   day/month  month day/week
      0-59   0-59   0-23     1-31     1-12    0-6
```

1. 添加 秒 字段, 定时器精确到 秒
2. 表达式说明与字段取值范围
3. 字段填充容器非c array而是hashtable, 所以修改为从offset开始填充

1. man 5 crontab (CentOS release 6.8 (Final))

```
              field          allowed values
              -----          --------------
              minute         0-59
              hour           0-23
              day of month   1-31
              month          1-12 (or names, see below)
              day of week    0-7 (0 or 7 is Sun, or use names)
```


2. man 5 crontab (OSX)

```
           field         allowed values
           -----         --------------
           minute        0-59
           hour          0-23
           day of month  1-31
           month         1-12 (or names, see below)
           day of week   0-7 (0 or 7 is Sun, or use names)
```

```
The time and date fields are:

        field          allowed values
        -----          --------------
        minute         0-59
        hour           0-23
        day of month   0-31
        month          0-12 (or names, see below)
        day of week    0-7 (0 or 7 is Sun, or use names)

 A  field  may  be an asterisk (*), which always stands for
 ``first-last''.

 Ranges of numbers are allowed.   Ranges  are  two  numbers
 separated  with  a  hyphen.  The specified range is inclu-
 sive.  For example, 8-11 for an ``hours'' entry  specifies
 execution at hours 8, 9, 10 and 11.

 Lists are allowed.  A list is a set of numbers (or ranges)
 separated by commas.  Examples: ``1,2,5,9'', ``0-4,8-12''.

 Step  values can be used in conjunction with ranges.  Fol-
 lowing a range with ``/<number>'' specifies skips  of  the
 number's value through the range.  For example, ``0-23/2''
 can be used in the hours field to specify  command  execu-
 tion  every other hour (the alternative in the V7 standard
 is ``0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22'').   Steps  are  also
 permitted after an asterisk, so if you want to say ``every
 two hours'', just use ``*/2''.

 Names can also be used for  the  ``month''  and  ``day  of
 week'' fields.  Use the first three letters of the partic-
 ular day or month (case doesn't matter).  Ranges or  lists
 of names are not allowed.


Note: The day of a command's execution can be specified by
two  fields  --  day  of  month, and day of week.  If both
fields are restricted (ie, aren't *), the command will  be
run when either field matches the current time.  For exam-
ple,
``30 4 1,15 * 5'' would cause a command to be run at  4:30
am on the 1st and 15th of each month, plus every Friday.
